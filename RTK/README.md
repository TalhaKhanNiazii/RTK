1. In this project I implemented the RTK (reduxToolkit) concept with simple reducer and extraReducers (i-e API called by createAsyncThunk).

2. Secondly I implemented concept of Async-Storage with different examples and scenarios.
   -> Storing and Getting single 'String' and then Array of Strings in PS1.jsx through Async-Storage.
   -> Storing and Getting object in PS2.jsx through Async-Storage.
   -> Merging 2 objects and Getting updated object in PS3.jsx through Async-Storage.
   -> Storing and Getting Mutiple Arrays data in PS4.jsx through Async-Storage. (multiSet/multiGet)
   -> Storing and Deleting values in PS5.jsx through Async-Storage.
