1. In this project I implemented the RTK (reduxToolkit) concept with simple reducer and extraReducers (i-e API called by createAsyncThunk) seperatly.

2. Secondly I implemented concept of Async-Storage with different examples and scenarios.
   -> Storing and Getting single 'String' and then Array of Strings in PS1.jsx through Async-Storage.
   -> Storing and Getting object in PS2.jsx through Async-Storage.
   -> Merging 2 objects and Getting updated object in PS3.jsx through Async-Storage.
   -> Storing and Getting Mutiple Arrays data in PS4.jsx through Async-Storage. (multiSet/multiGet)
   -> Storing and Deleting values in PS5.jsx through Async-Storage.

3. Additionally I created Async-Storage App using 'MyAsyncStack' you can check it out. In this sub app you will see login and logout features and storing data of user, Similarly you can create and delete a new contact using Async-Storage and you can see the contacts list on Home Screan.

4. Google Maps API setting done and used Google Maps basic functionality.

5. Wheather App UI done and All you need to call weather API.
